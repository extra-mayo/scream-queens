    <h1>Documentation</h1>

    <p>This game was built off from Assignment 2's game but I'll reiterate the inspirations and motivations that led
      to the creation of the game.</p>
    <h3>Long story short:</h3>
    <p>What were the motivations behind the game? Homework completion.</p>
    <p>What were the inspirations behind the game? My love for Scream Queens TV Show (and the fact that their plot
      goes hand-in-hand with the homework's criteria.)</p>

    <h3>Short story long:</h3>


    <p> I like Scream Queens. It's one of my favorite shows from this current season. So, I decided to model the
      chase game after the plot of Scream Queens Season 1 (with some minor alterations). P.S: Victims = Chanels =
      general names of the characters from the show.</p>
    <p>I mean, just watch Scream Queen's take on Taylor Swift's Gift Giving video: <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc6IziijhBI">"Chaneloween"</a></p>

    <p>For the majority of this game, I used Prof. Kapp's code as reference</p>


    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I simply set it to black. Couture.</p>

    <h2>Victim (Chanels)</h2>
    <p>I extracted images of Chanels screaming from the show. I thought this would be perfect for when the player gets
      close to the victim. The victim would then scream. Else, if the player is far away from the victim, then the
      victim would be depicted as nonchalant.</p>
    <p>When the victim screams, I thought it'd be a good idea to give the victim super-boosted adrenaline by having
      it go faster. To do so, I simply incremented its position by a constant pixel (0.5)</p>
    <p>When the victim is being portrayed as indifferent: I added a little speed boost over time using acceleration
      multiplier on the current constant speed of the victims. Basically, over time, the character moves a bit
      faster.</p>
    <p>How does the victim "avoid" the player? Well, there are many scenarios in which I had to address. Here are a
      few ex to get the gist:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When the victim is on the left of the player, and the player is facing left, make the victim run left, and
        etc.
      </li>
      <li>The victim switches direction when the player appears in a different direction. To clarify, when the
        victim is running towards to the left, but the player decides to run to the right and wrap-around to the
        other side of the screen, the character will then run right in an attempt to avoid the player appearing
        out of the nowhere.
      </li>
      <li>and etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Player (us)</h2>
    <p>The player is the red devil. We want to catch the Chanels (victims). So, we just run in whatever direction
      they're at. That's it.</p>
    <p>When we successfully kill the Chanels, we respawn in one of the four place, that is the left, right, top, and
      bottom of the canvas. Chanels respawn at the center. Likewise, whenever the Chanels successfuly escapes, we
      will respawn in one of the four random place, while the Chanels respawn at the center.</p>

    <h2>Enemy (Denise Hemphill)</h2>
    <p>In Scream Queens, Denise Hemphill was a semi-incompetent private security guard that served to protect
      Chanels from the Red Devil.</p>
    <p>So, in the game, Denise Hemphill will continously chase after the Red Devil (you).</p>

    <h3>Physical Controllers</h3>
    <p>In class, we created a simple physical controller for our game via Makey Makey keyboard emulator.</p>
    <p>Here's what the kit looks like:</p>
    <img src="docImages/keyboard.jpg" width="300px">

    <p>Then, we clipped the conductors onto the "W", "A", "S", "D", "Left", "Right", "Up", "Down" and a popsicle
      sick with aluminum foil on it </p>
    <img src="docImages/linking.jpg" width="300px">

    <p>And here's what the physical controller looked like after all that:</p>
    <img src="docImages/final.jpg" width="300px">

    <p>Then we tested out our controller with a classmate's game:</p>
    <img src="docImages/someones.jpg" width="300px">
    <p>It didn't go that well the few first rounds because of issues such as the wires not picking up anything, the
      wires aren't in direct contact with our hands, etc etc.</p>
    <p>But at least it worked to some extent.</p>
